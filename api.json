      "full": "Yeren, meaning \\\"wild man\\\" in Chinese, is a humanoid cryptid reported primarily from the Shennongjia Forestry District in Hubei Province, China, though reports exist from other remote mountain forests. Described as standing 6-7 feet tall, covered in reddish-brown hair with a human-like face and large feet, walking bipedally. Ancient Chinese texts reference wildmen, and modern sightings peaked in the 1970s-1980s. The phenomenon gained significant attention when the **Chinese Academy of Sciences organized official expeditions in the 1970s-1980s**, treating the search with scientific seriousness. Expeditions found hair samples claimed to be from unknown primates, footprints over 16 inches long, and collected witness testimonies. Some researchers theorize Yeren could be a descendant of Gigantopithecus, an extinct giant ape whose fossils have been found in China. The Shennongjia region established a nature reserve partially due to Yeren interest."
